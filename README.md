<h2>Semantics with Azure Language service</h2>

>*I recently conducted a demo using Azure AI Language Services to analyze a set of user reviews, and the results were impressive. The service quickly detected the language of each review, extracted key phrases, analyzed sentiment, and identified named entities such as people, locations, and organizations. One standout feature was entity linking, which contextually matched ambiguous terms like "Venus" to the appropriate Wikipedia page, whether referring to the planet or the mythological figure. This seamless transformation of unstructured text into a structured, semantically rich dataset showcased the true power of Azure's language intelligence capabilities.*
